<b>Reservations and Deposits</b><br>
We are happy to tentatively hold your reservation for 7 days.  Reservations are confirmed only upon receipt of a deposit on a first come, first served basis.  We accept deposits by personal check, money order, or by phone using your VISA or MasterCard.  Deposits are non-refundable, unless we can replace your reservations.  Please see the "<a href="#cancel">Cancellations</a>" section below for additional details.
<p>
<b>Final Payment</b><br>
The balance is due 60 days prior to the launch date of your trip.  If final payment is not received when due, we reserve the right to regard the reservation canceled.  In this case, your final payment will not be refunded, unless we can replace your reservations.
<p>
<b><a name="cancel">Cancellations</a></b><br>
Should you have to cancel your trip plans, deposits and final payments are non-refundable, unless we can replace your reservations.  Alternate guests are welcome.  If we replace your canceled space(s) with other guests, a $100 per invoice cancellation fee is charged.
<p>
Please understand that we cannot insure your investment in river trip reservations.   Once you reserve spots on a trip, we lose the right to sell your reserved space to other individuals or groups.  The number of trips we run as well as the spaces per trip are limited by river management plans, controlled by the U.S. Forest Service or State of Idaho Bureau of Land Management.  We regret that we cannot make exceptions for personal emergencies.  We strongly recommend the purchase of trip cancellation and interruption insurance if you are concerned about the above stated policies.

You will be required to sign a "<a href="waiver.html">Waiver/Liability Release Form</a>" in order to join a river trip with North Star River Expeditions, Inc.  We will send you such a form after you make reservations, at your request, or you may <a href="waiver.html">print the form from our site</a>.
<p>
<b>Trip Insurance</b><br>
We will send you information on Trip Insurance when you make reservations, or on request.  Cancellation and interruption insurance can include full refund should you cancel due to health, medical, and other reasons.  If you cannot afford to forfeit your reservation dollars, you should purchase trip cancellation insurance.
<p>
<b>USDA/FS Policy</b><br>

If we must cancel and cannot reschedule your trip on another river or on alternate dates, we will make a complete refund of all your moneys paid to North Star River Expeditions, Inc. for the trip.

<p>
<b>Liability</b><br>
North Star River Expeditions, Inc. spares nothing to assure that all trips we operate are the safest and best outfitted expeditions available.
