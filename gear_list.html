The key to packing for an outdoor adventure and especially for a rafting trip, is to pack light but pack for a wide range of weather conditions.  The chance for cold weather is VERY slim, but it can happen, and if it does you will be very happy to have that long underwear and fleece suit.  
<p>
Fabrics like polyester, wool, polypropelene, and some other synthetic fabrics like Nike ACG's Dri-Fit line are designed to wick moisture away from your skin so it will evaporate and allow your clothing to dry quickly if it gets wet.  These fabrics also keep you very warm, even when they are wet, unlike cotton, which holds moisture next to the skin and takes forever to dry, while keeping you cold.  On a rafting trip you are very likely to be splashed by waves or be in the water swimming, so you want shorts and other clothing that will dry quickly.  Cotton is ok to wear when it is very hot, because it will help to keep you cool.

Protection from the sun is important so please make sure you pack a hat, sunglasses, and plenty of sunscreen.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us!
