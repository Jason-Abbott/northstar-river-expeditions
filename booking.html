We are happy to tentatively hold your reservation for 7 days.  Reservations are confirmed only upon receipt of a deposit on a first come, first served basis.  We accept deposits by personal check, money order, or by phone using your VISA or MasterCard.  Deposits are non-refundable, unless we can replace your reservations.

<p>
<b>Final Payment</b><br>

<p>
Please understand that we cannot insure your investment in river trip reservations.   Once you reserve spots on a trip, we lose the right to sell your reserved space to other individuals or groups.  The number of trips we run as well as the spaces per trip are limited by river management plans, controlled by the U.S. Forest Service or State of Idaho Bureau of Land Management.  We regret that we cannot make exceptions for personal emergencies.  We strongly recommend the purchase of trip cancellation and interruption insurance if you are concerned about the above stated policies.

We will send you information on Trip Insurance when you make reservations, or on request.  Cancellation and interruption insurance can include full refund should you cancel due to health, medical, and other reasons.  If you cannot afford to forfeit your reservation dollars, you should purchase trip cancellation insurance.
