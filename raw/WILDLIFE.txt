WILDLIFE

Both Hells Canyon and the Salmon Canyon are home to a diverse population of wildlife. Mule deer, elk, Rocky Mountain big horn sheep, and mountain goats are the most often seen when we are on the river.  Occasionally we have the chance to spot bear, river otter, bobcats, and very rarely, cougar.   Both bald and golden eagles are seen in Hells Canyon soaring from rim to rim, and hunting along the river's edge.  Blue heron, king fishers, all types of water fowl, swallows, owls, red tailed hawks, and chukar are abundant-just to name a few!
